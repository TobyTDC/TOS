# TOS
myOS

This is the repository for my first OS - TOS

Day1:

Installed Ubuntu 16.04, installed g++ and qemu(took a while to figure out some issue with qemu), tried to follow mit6.828 but it seemed like the content is a little bit too advanced to me

Day2:

Started following a uploader on youtube , installed virtualbox and took a whole day to realize that the virtualbox has some issue with secure boot for ubuntu 16.04

Day3:

want to try to solve the virtualbox issue ; otherwise I need to switch to another series of videos 

try: https://askubuntu.com/questions/914997/install-virtualbox-while-keeping-secure-boot


Tried https://stegard.net/2016/10/virtualbox-secure-boot-ubuntu-fail/ and it worked!!!

However, I decide to switch to another uploader cause the previous one is a little bit out of date
